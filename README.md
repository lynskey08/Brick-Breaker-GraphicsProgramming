##Brick Break Game

**Instructions:**

* I have mostly tested this game on the browser Google Chrome and would recommend you do too
* The aim of the game is to deflect the ball off the paddle and to break all the bricks at the top of the canvas

**The Work**

*I used my Graphics Programming lecturer's, [Ian Mcloughlins github](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin)'s examples to help better understand the concept of javascript and html5 animations. 
*I also used [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Workflows/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript/Build_the_brick_field](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Workflows/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript/Build_the_brick_field) page to help with the drawing of the bricks on the canvas, and with the collision detection when the ball hits the bricks.I found this page extremely useful and easy to understand which contributed a lot to the project and my now understanding of javascript and html.
*I also used other various websites such as:
