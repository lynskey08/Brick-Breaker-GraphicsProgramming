##Brick Break Game

**Instructions:**

* I have mostly tested this game on the browser Google Chrome and would recommend you do too
* The aim of the game is to deflect the ball off the paddle and to break all the bricks at the top of the canvas

**The Work**
*I used my Graphics Programming lecturer's, Ian Mcloughlins github's page[https://github.com/ianmcloughlin](Ian Mcloughlins github) examples to help better understand the concept of javascript and html5 animations.
